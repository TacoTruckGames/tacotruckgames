  <h2>17. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>

  <p><strong>Governing Law.</strong> These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

  <p><strong>Informal Resolution.</strong> Before initiating any formal dispute resolution proceeding, you agree to first contact us at <a href="mailto:crystaldig@tacotruckgames.com">crystaldig@tacotruckgames.com</a> and attempt to resolve the dispute informally for at least thirty (30) days. If the dispute is not resolved within that period, either party may proceed as set forth below.</p>

  <p><strong>Binding Arbitration.</strong> Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Game that is not resolved through the informal resolution process described above shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding individual arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, except as modified by this section. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator in King County, Washington, or at another mutually agreed location. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms, including whether a claim is subject to arbitration. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p>

  <p><strong>CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</strong> YOU AND TACO TRUCK GAMES, LLC AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. IF THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION SHALL BE NULL AND VOID.</p>

  <p><strong>JURY TRIAL WAIVER.</strong> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND TACO TRUCK GAMES, LLC EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL FOR ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE GAME.</p>

  <p><strong>Small Claims Court Exception.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court for disputes within the jurisdiction of such court.</p>

  <p><strong>Opt-Out.</strong> You may opt out of this arbitration provision by sending written notice to <a href="mailto:crystaldig@tacotruckgames.com">crystaldig@tacotruckgames.com</a> within thirty (30) days of first downloading, installing, or using the Game. Your notice must include your name, mailing address, and a clear statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration agreement. If you opt out, you and Taco Truck Games, LLC may pursue claims in court, subject to the governing law and jurisdiction provisions of these Terms, and disputes shall be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in King County, Washington.</p>

  <h2>18. Assignment</h2>
  <p>We may assign or transfer our rights and obligations under these Terms without restriction, including in connection with a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or by operation of law. You may not assign or transfer your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. Any attempted assignment in violation of this section shall be null and void. These Terms shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each party's successors and permitted assigns.</p>

  <h2>19. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by updating the "Last Updated" date at the bottom of these Terms and, where appropriate, providing additional notice within the Game. Your continued use of the Game after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

  <h2>20. Severability</h2>
  <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.</p>

  <h2>21. Entire Agreement</h2>
  <p>These Terms, together with our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, constitute the entire agreement between you and Taco Truck Games, LLC regarding the Game and supersede all prior agreements, understandings, and communications, whether written or oral.</p>
