    Taco Truck Games, LLC<br>

    <strong>Owner contact email:</strong> meowwars@tacotruckgames.com
  </p>

  <!-- ============================================================ -->
  <h2>Applicability</h2>
  <p>This privacy policy applies to Meow Wars: Card Battle on all platforms where it is distributed, including Steam, the Apple App Store, and the Google Play Store. References to "this Application" throughout this document refer to the Game on any supported platform.</p>

  <!-- ============================================================ -->
  <h2>Types of Data Collected</h2>
  <p>
    Among the types of Personal Data that this Application collects, by itself or through third parties, there are:
    Cookies, Usage Data, unique device identifiers (such as Advertising ID / IDFA), and purchase transaction data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Complete details on each type of Personal Data collected are provided in the dedicated sections of this privacy policy or by specific explanation texts displayed prior to the Data collection.
  </p>
  <p>
    Personal Data may be freely provided by the User, or, in case of Usage Data, collected automatically when using this Application. Unless specified otherwise, all Data requested by this Application is mandatory and failure to provide this Data may make it impossible for this Application to provide its services. In cases where this Application specifically states that some Data is not mandatory, Users are free not to communicate this Data without consequences to the availability or the functioning of the Service.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any use of Cookies &mdash; or of other tracking tools &mdash; by this Application or by the owners of third-party services used by this Application serves the purpose of providing the Service required by the User, in addition to any other purposes described in the present document.
  </p>
  <p>
    Users are responsible for any third-party Personal Data obtained, published or shared through this Application and confirm that they have the third party's consent to provide the Data to the Owner.
  </p>

  <!-- ============================================================ -->
  <h2>Mode and Place of Processing the Data</h2>

  <h3>Methods of Processing</h3>
  <p>
    The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of the Data. The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of this Application (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or external parties (such as third-party technical service providers, hosting providers, IT companies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner. The updated list of these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.
  </p>

  <h3>Legal Basis of Processing</h3>
  <p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing ("opt-out"), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not apply whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;</li>
    <li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;</li>
    <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;</li>
    <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;</li>
    <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>

  <h3>Place</h3>
  <p>
    The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located. Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a country other than their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data, Users can check the section containing details about the processing of Personal Data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data. If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with the Owner using the information provided in the contact section.
  </p>
  <p>
    Where Personal Data is transferred from the EEA to a country that has not been deemed to provide an adequate level of data protection by the European Commission, the Owner relies on Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission, or other appropriate safeguards as permitted under the GDPR, to ensure your Personal Data is protected.
  </p>

  <h3>Retention Time</h3>
  <p>Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for and in accordance with the following specific retention periods:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Usage and analytics data:</strong> Retained for up to 26 months from the date of collection, after which it is anonymized or deleted.</li>
    <li><strong>Purchase and transaction records:</strong> Retained for up to 7 years as required for tax compliance and financial recordkeeping obligations.</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising identifiers (Advertising ID / IDFA):</strong> Retained until consent is withdrawn, the identifier is reset by the User, or the User requests deletion.</li>
    <li><strong>Multiplayer and backend data (Photon Engine):</strong> Retained for the duration of the User's use of the Game, plus 30 days following account deletion or data deletion request.</li>
    <li><strong>Personal Data collected for the performance of a contract:</strong> Retained until such contract has been fully performed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.
  </p>

  <!-- ============================================================ -->

  <h2>The Rights of Users</h2>
  <p>Users may exercise certain rights regarding their Data processed by the Owner.</p>
  <p>In particular, Users have the right to do the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Withdraw their consent at any time.</strong> Users have the right to withdraw consent where they have previously given their consent to the processing of their Personal Data.</li>

    <li><strong>Verify and seek rectification.</strong> Users have the right to verify the accuracy of their Data and ask for it to be updated or corrected.</li>
    <li><strong>Restrict the processing of their Data.</strong> Users have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of their Data. In this case, the Owner will not process their Data for any purpose other than storing it.</li>
    <li><strong>Have their Personal Data deleted or otherwise removed.</strong> Users have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of their Data from the Owner.</li>
    <li><strong>Receive their Data and have it transferred to another controller.</strong> Users have the right to receive their Data in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance.</li>
    <li><strong>Lodge a complaint.</strong> Users have the right to bring a claim before their competent data protection supervisory authority. A list of EU data protection authorities can be found at <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Details About the Right to Object to Processing</h3>
  <p>
    Where Personal Data is processed for a public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in the Owner or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner, Users may object to such processing by providing a ground related to their particular situation to justify the objection.
  </p>
  <p>
    Users must know that, however, should their Personal Data be processed for direct marketing purposes, they can object to that processing at any time without providing any justification.
  </p>

  <h3>How to Exercise These Rights</h3>
  <p>
    Any requests to exercise User rights can be directed to the Owner through the contact details provided in this document. These requests can be exercised free of charge and will be addressed by the Owner as early as possible and always within one month.
  </p>

  <h3>How to Withdraw Consent</h3>
  <p>
    Where processing is based on consent, Users may withdraw consent at any time by contacting the Owner at the email address listed in the "Owner and Data Controller" section above, or by adjusting their device settings as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Tracking (to revoke ad tracking consent)</li>
    <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Ads (to opt out of personalized ads)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Withdrawing consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing carried out prior to the withdrawal, nor does it affect processing of Personal Data conducted on a lawful basis other than consent.
  </p>

  <!-- ============================================================ -->
  <h2>Account and Data Deletion</h2>
  <p>Users may request deletion of their Personal Data at any time by contacting the Owner:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Email:</strong> Send a deletion request to <a href="mailto:meowwars@tacotruckgames.com">meowwars@tacotruckgames.com</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- ============================================================ -->
  <h2>Additional Information About Data Collection and Processing</h2>

  <h3>Legal Action</h3>
  <p>
    The User's Personal Data may be used for legal purposes by the Owner in Court or in the stages leading to possible legal action arising from improper use of this Application or the related Services. The User declares to be aware that the Owner may be required to reveal personal data upon request of public authorities.
  </p>

  <h3>System Logs and Maintenance</h3>
  <p>
    For operation and maintenance purposes, this Application and any third-party services may collect files that record interaction with this Application (System logs) or use other Personal Data (such as the IP Address) for this purpose.
  </p>

  <h3>Information Not Contained in This Policy</h3>
  <p>
    More details concerning the collection or processing of Personal Data may be requested from the Owner at any time. Please see the contact information at the beginning of this document.
  </p>

  <h3>How "Do Not Track" and Opt-Out Preference Signals Are Handled</h3>
  <p>
    This Application recognizes and honors Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals as valid opt-out requests for the sale and sharing of Personal Information, as required by applicable law. When the Owner detects a GPC signal from your browser or device, the Owner will treat it as a request to opt out of the sale or sharing of your Personal Information for targeted advertising purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    For other "Do Not Track" (DNT) browser signals, there is currently no industry-wide standard for how applications should respond. To determine whether any of the third-party services used by this Application honor DNT requests, please read their respective privacy policies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Regardless of signal support, Users may opt out of personalized advertising at any time through the device-level controls or the third-party opt-out links described in the "Information About Opting Out of Interest-Based Advertising" section above.
  </p>

  <h3>Data Breach Notification</h3>
  <p>
    In the event of a data breach that affects Users' Personal Data, the Owner will notify affected Users and relevant supervisory authorities in accordance with applicable laws, including the GDPR's 72-hour notification requirement to supervisory authorities where applicable. Notification will include a description of the nature of the breach, the categories and approximate number of Users affected, the likely consequences of the breach, and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach and mitigate its effects.
  </p>

  <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
  <p>
    The Owner reserves the right to make changes to this privacy policy at any time by giving notice to its Users on this page. It is strongly recommended to check this page often, referring to the date of the last modification listed at the bottom. Should the changes affect processing activities performed on the basis of the User's consent, the Owner shall collect new consent from the User, where required.
  </p>

  <!-- ============================================================ -->
  <h2>Your California Privacy Rights (CCPA/CPRA)</h2>
  <p>This section applies to Users who are California residents and supplements the information contained in the rest of this privacy policy. It is provided pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (collectively, "CCPA").</p>

  <h3>Categories of Personal Information Collected</h3>

  </ul>

  <h3>Sale and Sharing of Personal Information</h3>
  <p>The Owner does not "sell" Personal Information in the traditional sense of the word (i.e., for monetary consideration). However, the use of Unity Ads for personalized advertising may constitute "sharing" of Personal Information (such as Advertising ID, Usage Data, and advertising interaction data) with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes as defined under the CCPA.</p>
  <p>The Owner does not have actual knowledge that it sells or shares the Personal Information of consumers under 16 years of age.</p>

  <h3>Your Rights Under the CCPA</h3>
